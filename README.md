Flavorite
=========

Favorite is simple (but still powerfull!) recommendation engine based on cosine similarity between items. It requies only sequence of tuples like `(user_id, item_id, rating)` and allows to find top N items closest to the given one (people-who-liked-that-also-liked-this kind of algorithm). This repository is packed with parser for [Combosaurus](http://combosaurus.com/) data and can be directly used to find most similar shows (see below).
